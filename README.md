# EE224-Project-IITB-CPU

We had to make a 16-bit CPU with 14 instructions, including Arithmetic, Logic, Branch, Jump, Load and Store. 

The CPU, although it looks simple, has a lot of features including a register file with 8 16-bit registers, 1KB worth of memory, 3 16-bit temporary registers and an ALU that can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, bitwise AND, bitwise OR and bitwise Implication functions.
